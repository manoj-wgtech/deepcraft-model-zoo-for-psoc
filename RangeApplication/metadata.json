  "description": "Detect and measure objects within a predefined range using radar and PSOC\u2122 6.",
  "long_description": "This application demonstrates the use of Infineon's XENSIV\u2122 60 GHz radar sensor radar sensor (BGT60TR13C) and PSOC\u2122 6 MCU to detect objects and estimate their distance within a predefined range in real time. The solution performs on-device radar signal processing for accurate, low-latency, and privacy-preserving range measurement.",
